	HOWEVER , THE RESORCES IS GRANTED TO IN  A SEQUNCIAL ORDER .

	A DEADLOCK A SITUACTION  WERE EACH OF THE COMPUTER PROCESS WAIT FOR THE RESORCES WHICH IS ALREADY BEING ASSIGN TO SOME ANOTHER PROCESS . 
IN THIS SITUATION ,NONE OF THE PROCESS GETS EXECUITED SINCES THE RECORED IT NEEDS, THAT IS HELD BY SOME OTHER PROCESS WHICH IS ALSO WAITING FOR SOME OTHER RESORCES TO BE REALESE .

	LET ASUME THAT THERE ARE 3 PROCESS P1,P2,P3.	THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT  RESORCES  R1,R2,R3  . 	R1 ASSIGN TO P1.		R2 ASSIGN TO P2.		AND 
R3 ASSIGN TO P3.

	AFTER SOME TIME P1 DEMANDS  FOR R2  WHICH IS BEING USED BY P2.	P2 ALSO DEMAND  FOR R3  WHICH IS ALREADY BEING  USED BY P3.      P3 ALSO DEMAND FOR R1 WHICH IS BEING USED BY P1 .

	IN THIS SITUATION , A CYCLE  IS BEING FROMED AMOMG THE 3 PROCESS AND  3 RESORECES  AND  BECAUSE OF THAT CYCLE  NONE OF THE PROCESS IS PROGRESSSIVE AND ALL THE PROCESS  ARE IN WAITING . THEREFORE  THE COMPUTER BECOMES UNRESPONCIVE  SINCE ALL THE PROCESSES GOT BLOCKED  THAT IS CALLED DEADLOCK .
